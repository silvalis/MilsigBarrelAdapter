 ## What is it?
 
 This is a printable 16mm barrel adapter for the M79 Milsig HPA Dart blaster. It allows typical 16mm (and similar diameter) barrels to be installed into the M79 with a collet design. I've been sitting on this design for nearly a year and have decided to release it to the public.

 M79 Barrel Adapters
 
There are two designs released here:
 
 ### Base Adapter 
 This adapter is for the default M79 handguard barrel nut. The flanges should sit flush on the top of the nut to minimise sideways movement.
 Print:
 1x Base Adapter
 
 ### Threaded Adapter
 This adapter has a printed nut and lower threading to tighten down on any other barrel nut you may find, provided that it's smaller than stock. Install the adapter, then tension the nut down onto the top of the barrel nut.
 Print:
 1x Base Adapter Threaded
 1x Nut
 
 ### Common parts
 You will also need to print:
 1x Collet
 1x Cap
 
 
 
 ## Issues
 
 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
 
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE INCURRED TO YOUR M79
 
 It's important to note that the design has strength issues. The intent was to create an FDM printable adapater (which worked) however if your barrel is unprotected anywhere along its length and you give it a good whack, you will likely **snap the adapter** at the base, around where the O-ring sits. Use a pick to unthread and remove the broken section from your milsig once you have snapped it.
 
 I suggest printing on an angle to give it a bit more lateral strength, eg

 45 deg angle
 
 Note: I think I've tried a 30 and a 45, not sure if there was any diff in strength.
